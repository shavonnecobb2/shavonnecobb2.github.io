title: A Square is NOT A Rectangle (According to Liskov)
---

According to the Liskov Substitution Principle, a "good" inheritance hierarchy will require that behaviors from base types must be substitutable by their subtypes. Therefore, the inheritance hierarchy stating that quadrilateral (grandparent) > rectangle (parent) > square (child) does not withhold as a "good" inheritance hierarchy according to the LSP. 
Yes while this statement is valid within the mathematical world, it does not hold within an object-oriented program world. The reason behind this madness is due to the simple fact that squares do not hold a particular behavioral substitution from rectangles. By the assumption set by rectangles, a height and width value can be set independently; this is not a true assumption for squares considering they possess their own assumption stating that all sides must be equal - therefore height and width cannot be set independently. 
So, due to this, the LSP is violated since a square cannot subsitute all behaviors from its base type, the rectangle.

According to the Oracle docs, the Observer class (which implements the Observer interface) is notified whenever an observed object has changed. Therefore, creating an observer pattern using the Java language is fairly simple. Because Java already has its own predefined Observer interface within its core libraries, users of the language must simply call upon the interface to begin creating an observer pattern. By applying the interface, users may then create an Observer class and how many other Observable classess they want. Because of the Observer interface handed by Java, the Observer class possesses unique methods that can be used for its own sake and Observable objects. To wrap up the Observer pattern, it is useful for producing notifications about any changes that may occur on a particular object you are interested in. And with the Java language, keeping an eye on that object just got a heck of a lot easier!

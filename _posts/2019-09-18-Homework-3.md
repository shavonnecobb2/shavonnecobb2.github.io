title: I Have What in My Kitchen?!
---

Today's homework assignment asks me to assess my kitchen and report back a grandparent > parent > child relationship that occurs. Since
I wasn't particularly sure if my first answer would count - I decided to share two! I also decided to share the relationship backwards
from how I stated it earlier :)

1. Ice cubes (child) > Freezer's ice maker (parent) > Water supply (grandparent) [the reason I got tripped on this one is because
technically electricity also plays a part in the creation of ice cubes so I wasn't sure this could still count.]

1. Chilled items (child) > Refrigerator (parent) > Electricity (grandparent)

1. [Bonus! This just popped into my head!] Clean dishes (child) > Dishwasher (parent) > Water (grandparent) [Again, electricity also plays a part >.<]

This is oddly addicting to consider!
